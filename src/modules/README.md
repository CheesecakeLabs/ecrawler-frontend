# Modules

This section contains logical modules, they implement Redux actions and
reducers, as well as any extra helper functions that might be needed in the
module context. A module is a block of code for a related functionality or
instance.  

It should be implemented with this format:  

module-name/  
-- actions.js  
-- reducers.js  
-- <extra-helper>.js  

After that include your module reducers to the root reducer file.
